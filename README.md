# Project1
Description:

This repository contains a comprehensive proposal for the purchase of Drizzle planes aircraft. The proposal outlines the aircraft's specifications, financial analysis, operational considerations, and a detailed timeline for acquisition and integration into our fleet.

Data collection
We compiled data on various aircraft categories that could influence our project's transition. This dataset spans from 1923 to 2023 and includes information on accidents and the number of people affected.

Data Analysis
We read the data using pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Although it contained unrequired columns, we were able to drop them and filter out some of the columns to fit our data and our business question at hand.

Data Manipulation
Due to its many null values and duplicates, we took action, such as imputing some of the columns with different values, that would help create clear visuals for better presentation.

Data Visualizations.
We were able to devise different visualizations to answer the business questions and clearly explain to the investors why the idea works and why they should consider it the best course of action for the company.

Powerpoint Presentation.
We also came up with a PowerPoint presentation to aid in explaining to the investors why the company has been experiencing the problem in hand and find ways to change that and come up with a better solution for the company.
